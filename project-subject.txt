"Reason:"
    I chose to create a website for a solar company because of my personal interest in renewable energy and its potential to combat climate change. 
    As someone involved in solar installation, I see this project as an opportunity to not only showcase my work but also to build a personal website 
    that reflects my expertise in the field. I believe that solar energy is a sustainable solution that can benefit both individuals and communities. 
    By developing this website, I aim to raise awareness about the advantages of solar energy and provide a resource for potential customers seeking 
    reliable solar solutions. Additionally, this project allows me to apply the skills Iâ€™ve learned in web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
    in a meaningful way.
